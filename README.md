# Amazon-web-services-practicals-IM-2011-089

This practicals mainly for practicing  and Understanding how to use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), EC2 and EBS, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and AutoScaling, RDS and DynamoDB is a fundamental task for any aspiring AWS Architect.

 First we have to create account in Aws cloud achadamy to access lab practicals guide.
 There are 11 lab guides for amazon web services we have to follow the steps .

 For access the amazon web service console we have to create the new accounta for access the services we have to sign in .

There are lot of services avilable in aws console the following image show the available services in AWS console .

 1.CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON EC2 INSTANCE (LINUX)

Following steps I foowed when i was folowing this lab ,first Log In to the Amazon Web Service Console,Create an EC2 instance,Convert a PEM key to a PPK key( I have learnt  how to generate a PPK (PuTTY key) using the AWS PEM key),Connect to a remote shell using an SSH connection,Get the EC2 instance metadata( cover How to get the EC2 instance ID and other useful metadata) and finally Terminate an EC2 instance(How to destroy an EC2 instance).


2. CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON EC2 INSTANCE (WINDOWS) 

Amazon EC2 is the most famous AWS service and allows you to launch different types of cloud instances and pay for them with a pay-per-use approach. With Amazon EC2 you can create new servers in a few minutes and use different images (AMI) to personalize them. AWS provides several Microsoft Windows Server AMIs that enables you to run any compatible Windows-based solution. You can use Windows-based applications, websites, and web-services written in .NET, for data processing, media transcoding, and any other task requiring Windows software.

3.MANAGING INSTANCE VOLUMES USING EBS

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.  Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure. This provides high availability and durability. Amazon EBS volumes offer consistent, low-latency performance needed to run your workloads.


4.CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON S3 BUCKET

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), provides secure, durable, and highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. You'll pay only for the storage you actually use with no minimum fee and no setup cost. It can be used alone, or together with other AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), and Amazon Glacier. You can also use Amazon S3 with third-party storage repositories and gateways.

5.CREATE AN EBS-BACKED LINUX AMI

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an EC2 instance. You can customize an EC2 instance and then save the configuration as a custom AMI for your private or public use. Every EC2 instance launched selecting the customized AMI will contain any software or file that you've previously added.During this lab, i have setup a webserver EC2 instance starting from a Linux AMI, and then generate a new AMI.

7.INTRODUCTION TO DYNAMODB  

Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL Database in the cloud, suitable for anyone needing a reliable and fully managed NoSQL solution. DynamoDB is designed to provide automated storage scaling and low latency. It is particularly useful when your application must read and store massive amounts of data and you need speed and reliability (Amazon works with replicas of you database in three different Availability Zones). Amazon DynamoDB is totally managed. You simply select an AWS region, define the needed indexes for each table you will create, and Amazon takes care of everything else.
